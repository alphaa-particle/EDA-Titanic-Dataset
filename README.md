# Titanic EDA  

## Overview  
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical insights to understand factors influencing survival rates.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this analysis is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, which includes information about passengers such as age, gender, class, fare, and survival status.  

## Contents  
- **`Titanic_EDA.ipynb`** – Jupyter Notebook containing the full exploratory data analysis.
- **`Modified_Titanic.csv`** – csv downloaded via Kaggle for the analysis.  
- **`README.md`** – Documentation for the repository.  

## Key Steps in Analysis  
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Converting categorical data to numerical formats  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Summary statistics  
   - Visualizing survival rates based on different factors (age, gender, class, etc.)  
3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Creating new relevant features  
   - Correlation analysis  
4. **Insights & Conclusions**  
   - Identifying key factors that influenced survival rates  

## Requirements  
To run this notebook, you need the following Python libraries:  

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Titanic_EDA.git
cd Titanic_EDA

jupyter notebook Titanic_EDA.ipynb
